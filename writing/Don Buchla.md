# Don Buchla

American instrument designer (1937-2016) - founder of [[Synthesis - Music|West Coast synthesis]]. Rejected keyboards in favour of touch-sensitive interfaces. Built instruments for exploration, not imitation.

## Life

- Born South Orange, New Jersey
- Physics + physiology background
- [[San Francisco Tape Music Center]] - met [[Morton Subotnick]], [[Pauline Oliveros]]
- Founded Buchla & Associates (1963)
- Died September 2016, Berkeley

## Instruments

**Buchla 100 Series (1963)**
- First modular synth (parallel to [[Robert Moog|Moog]])
- Commissioned by [[Morton Subotnick]] + [[Ramon Sender]]
- Touch-controlled, not keyboard
- [[San Francisco Tape Music Center]] installation

**Buchla 200 Series (1970)**
- Expanded modular system
- 259 Programmable Complex Waveform Generator
- 281 Quad Function Generator
- 266 Source of Uncertainty - controlled randomness
- 292 Quad Low Pass Gate

**Buchla Music Easel (1973)**
- Portable, self-contained
- Complete West Coast voice
- Cult instrument - modern reissues

**Later Systems**
- 300 Series - hybrid digital/analogue
- 700 - digital
- 200e (2004) - modern remake with presets

## Key Innovations

**[[Low Pass Gate|Low Pass Gates]]**
- Combined VCF + VCA
- [[Vactrol]]-based (LED + photoresistor)
- Natural, organic decay
- "Bongo" character

**Complex Oscillators**
- [[Waveshaping]] built-in
- Wavefolding for harmonic control
- FM capabilities
- Timbre as primary parameter

**Touch Plates**
- Capacitive touch interfaces
- Rejected keyboard paradigm
- Position + pressure sensitive
- Encouraged exploration over virtuosity

**Source of Uncertainty**
- Controlled randomness module
- Fluctuating + sampled random outputs
- Influenced by [[John Cage]]
- Generative composition tool

## Philosophy

- Instruments should suggest, not dictate
- Against keyboard hegemony
- "Electronic instrument" not "synthesiser"
- Exploration over reproduction
- Performer as collaborator with machine

## Influence

- [[Morton Subotnick]] - primary collaborator
- [[Suzanne Ciani]] - Buchla performer
- [[Pauline Oliveros]] - Tape Music Center colleague
- [[Make Noise]] - modern West Coast revival
- [[Mutable Instruments]] - digital implementations
