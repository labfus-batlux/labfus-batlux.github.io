# Body Without Organs

Concept from [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] in [[Anti-Oedipus]] and [[A Thousand Plateaus]] - not a body lacking organs, but a body freed from *organisation*.

## Core Idea

**Not anatomical** - refers to the way bodies are *organised*
- Organs impose fixed functions
- BwO = potential before organisation constrains it
- Plane of [[Immanence]] where desire flows freely

**Against the Organism**
- Organism = hierarchical organisation of body
- BwO opposes stratification, not organs themselves
- "The enemy is the organism" - rigid functional assignments

## Origins

**Artaud's Influence**
- Term from [[Antonin Artaud]] - schizophrenic poet
- "To be done with the judgment of god"
- Body as intensity, not utility

**Spinozan Roots**
- "What can a body do?" - [[Spinoza]]
- Body defined by capacities, affects
- Not by organs or structure

## Types of BwO

**Full BwO**
- Productive, life-affirming
- Allows flows, connections
- Nomadic, experimental

**Empty BwO**
- Cancerous, destructive
- Hypochondriac, paranoid, drugged
- Blocks all flows - "fascist BwO"

**Key Distinction**
- Good BwO = destratification that enables new connections
- Bad BwO = total destratification (death, catatonia)

## How to Make One

Deleuze/Guattari's instructions:
1. Lodge on a [[Stratum]] - don't abandon it recklessly
2. Experiment carefully
3. Find potential movements, flows
4. Avoid mimicry, avoid suicide

"You never reach the BwO, you can't reach it, you are forever attaining it"

## Connections to Desire

**Desiring-Machines**
- BwO is surface where [[Desiring-Machines]] attach
- Desire = productive, not lack-based
- Against [[Psychoanalysis|Freudian]] interpretation

**Anti-Oedipal**
- Rejects Oedipal triangulation (mommy-daddy-me)
- Desire flows across BwO freely
- Social, not familial

**Against [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]**
- Rejects desire as lack ([[Object a]])
- [[Jouissance]] without castration
- Productive unconscious vs structured unconscious
- But: both engage [[The Real]] (differently)

## Examples

- Masochist's body - reorganises pain/pleasure
- Hypochondriac body - organs in wrong places
- Drugged body - altered intensities
- Schizo body - decoded flows
- Tantric body - erotic as full-body intensity

## The LPG as Body Without Organs

**[[Synthesis - Music|Synthesis]] Connection**

The [[Synthesis - Music|Low Pass Gate]] embodies the BwO:
- Combines filter (organisation) and amplifier (intensity)
- [[Don Buchla|Vactrol]]-based - organic, unpredictable response curves
- Creates "natural" sounds without ADSR (no symbolic articulation)
- Simultaneous amplitude and timbral flux
- Refuses separation of loudness from brightness

**Sound Before the Organism**
- LPG = sound before organs assign functions
- [[Synthesis - Music|West Coast synthesis]] = molecular vs molar
- Waveshaping = adding intensities (vs subtractive filtering)
- Feedback patching = rhizomatic connections

**[[Gilbert Simondon|Simondon]] Connection**
- BwO relates to pre-individual reality
- Metastability before individuation
- Transduction across intensities
- Both Deleuze and synthesis explore becoming

## Political Dimension

**Capitalism & BwO**
- Capital as "socius" - organises bodies for production
- BwO resists capture by [[Capitalism|capitalist]] organisation
- Revolutionary potential in becoming-other

**Micropolitics**
- Personal BwO experiments = political acts
- Transformation of desire, not just ideology
- [[Schizoanalysis]] as method

## Key Quotes

> "The BwO is what remains when you take everything away"

> "Dismantling the organism has never meant killing yourself"

## Against [[G.W.F. Hegel|Hegel]]

**The Anti-Dialectical Project**
- [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]]'s *Difference and Repetition* (1968): explicit anti-Hegelianism
- Difference without negation — not thesis/antithesis
- Multiplicity without [[Aufhebung]] — no resolution into One
- BwO as escape from [[Dialectic|dialectical]] totality

**Critique of [[Aufhebung]]**
- Aufhebung = recuperation, capture
- Every transgression sublated back into system
- Hegel: difference resolved into identity
- D&G: difference affirmed as irreducible

**Yet Structurally Hegelian?**

| [[G.W.F. Hegel\|Hegelian]] | D&G Equivalent |
|---------------------------|----------------|
| Thesis | Stratum (organised) |
| Antithesis | Line of flight (escape) |
| Synthesis | New assemblage |
| Spirit's self-development | Becoming |

*The difference*: for Hegel, synthesis is *goal*; for D&G, it's *trap*

**BwO vs [[Geist|Spirit]]**
- [[Geist]]: collective consciousness developing through history
- BwO: surface of pure intensity *before* subjectivity
- Hegel: subject as achievement of dialectic
- D&G: subject as limitation to be overcome
- BwO = what remains when you subtract [[Aufhebung]]

**[[Slavoj Žižek|Žižek]]'s Response**
- D&G secretly more Hegelian than they admit
- Their "difference" still opposes identity (thus dialectical)
- True escape from Hegel requires engaging him
- BwO might be Hegelian Absolute misunderstood
